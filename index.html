        <main>
          <p>I am a dedicated Web and UX design student with a passion for creating user-friendly, visually appealing, and impactful digital experiences. Transitioning from my previous career in healthcare, I am fully immersed in learning how to design websites and interfaces that blend aesthetic appeal with functionality. My goal is to craft seamless and intuitive user journeys, making technology more accessible and enjoyable for all.</p>

          <p>Currently honing my skills in web design and UX principles, I am proficient in wireframing, prototyping, and responsive design. I am also gaining expertise in key tools such as Adobe XD, Figma, and Visual Studio Code. My approach is grounded in understanding user needs through research and empathy, ensuring that my designs not only look good but solve real problems and enhance usability.</p>
          
          <p>I am excited to apply my creativity and technical skills in professional environments like digital agencies, startups, or organizations focused on innovative web solutions. Whether working on website redesigns, improving user interfaces, or developing prototypes, I strive to deliver designs that engage users and drive results. I am particularly passionate about staying up-to-date with emerging design trends and UX best practices, ensuring that my work reflects both current standards and forward-thinking strategies.</p>
          
          <p>Collaboration is at the heart of my process, and I thrive in environments where I can work with multidisciplinary teams to bring digital concepts to life. My ultimate goal is to contribute to projects that improve user experiences, making the web a more engaging, intuitive, and accessible space for all.</p>
