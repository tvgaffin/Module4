                        <p>For this project, I designed wireframes and developed a prototype for an app focused on pet needs and services. The app allows users to purchase products, schedule pet appointments, and access various other services.</p>

                        <p>I worked on designing a website for a fake local plant nursery, aiming to enhance their online presence and customer engagement. The project began with research to understand user needs and analyze competitors in the industry. I developed wireframes and prototypes to establish a user-friendly layout and navigation. The design featured vibrant visuals and a responsive layout to showcase plant categories and gardening tips effectively. Using HTML and CSS, I built interactive elements like a plant care guide and a shopping cart.</p>
